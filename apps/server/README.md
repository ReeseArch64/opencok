# Experimental realm server

This is the first migration slice of the working Bun `apps/new-server` proof of
concept. It preserves the mobile **12.06.0** SFS binary protocol and adapts its
login, city bootstrap and world reads to the existing PostgreSQL Drizzle models.
The runtime requires Bun 1.4.2 and the workspace layout.

Implemented commands: `cmd.finishinit`, `cmd.ping`, `login.dataconfig`,
`login.other`, `setting.xml`, `build.info` and `world.get`. The SFS handshake, login rejection,
session replacement, fragmentation, zlib input and signed 64-bit values are
preserved. Construction, queue completion, combat and other mutations return
`102192` (unsupported). Reading the city never settles queues or changes resources.

## Code organization

`src/index.ts` composes Effect Layers and runs the shared process runtime;
`src/config.ts` provides the RealmConfig service from the shared environment Layer. The composition root wires the shared packages described
in the [architecture package map](../../.github/ARCHITECTURE.md#implemented-api-and-realm-package-boundaries).
`src/server.ts` loads the rule catalog and connects `@opencok/connection/server`
to repositories, Redis/ZooKeeper adapters and command controllers. The dependency
Layer owns pools and coordination; the connection Layer owns TCP/health listeners
and a scoped readiness fiber. Shutdown waits for health checks, stops accepting
connections and drains session work before releasing dependencies. API and realm
share `@opencok/core/http` and `@opencok/core/runtime`.

`startServer(config)` remains a Promise boundary for embedded/integration callers,
backed by a ManagedRuntime whose `close()` disposes the service scopes. It cleans
up on failed startup and tolerates repeated close calls. TCP packet ordering,
backpressure, controllers and synchronous rules remain independent of Effect. See
[ADR-0012](../../docs/decisions/0012-adopt-effect-for-service-composition.md).

## Start locally

From the repository root:

```sh
docker compose --profile dev up --build -d --wait
```

The root `.env` contains `NODE_ENV`, `DATABASE_ROLE`, `DATABASE_URL` and the
private `GAME_LOGIN_SECRET` exception. Other development values are direct
Compose settings, still validated by the shared Zod schemas through `@opencok/env/effect`. Authorized XML comes from the complete local reference
copy at `data/reference/server/runtime/base/resource`; the runtime does not
reference another checkout. Direct Bun execution requires providing the remaining
service/resource settings through its process environment.

The root [Compose stack](../../infra/compose/README.md) starts this server, the
shared discovery API, gateway, PostgreSQL, Redis, ZooKeeper and MinIO CDN. It mounts the XML
directory read-only and uses a container-specific database URL. For direct Bun
execution, provide reachable PostgreSQL/Redis/ZooKeeper endpoints separately. Each running realm needs its own TCP/health ports and
`KINGDOM_ID`. The PostgreSQL topology setup initializes realms 1 and 2 with the
same schema. Advertise the corresponding `COK<id>` zone and TCP endpoint through
the existing discovery issuer; the shared API implements discovery; registration remains unavailable.

Relative XML paths are resolved from the workspace root, independently of the
command working directory. The XML loader requires `building.xml`, `role.xml` and `position.xml`.
`item.xml` supplies `login.dataconfig`; `arms.xml` and `goods.xml` are needed for
persisted troops/inventory. `function_star.xml` and `function_on.xml` describe
building star rules and optional features. Files remain local authorized inputs;
read-only mobile originals must be extracted in a separate working directory.

`setting.xml` is optional. Its command returns every configured setting with its ID
and values encoded as strings, or an empty array when the catalog is absent. XML
catalogs accept single records and multiple/nested groups. Duplicate IDs fail except
for the existing goods and feature replacement policies. Values retain leading
zeroes and whitespace; malformed records and document type declarations fail loading.

Building star availability evaluates numeric client versions, realm selectors and
inclusive start/end boundaries at the command's injected time. Legacy dates use
`yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm`, interpreted in UTC for this server, independently of the host
timezone. Invalid dates, versions and selectors fail closed instead of inheriting
the Java parser's lenient date rollover or invalid-date epoch fallback. Test-realm
selectors and explicit timezone offsets are supported by the pure availability
evaluator; the running realm uses the online selector and UTC. This changes only
availability/read previews; construction remains unsupported.

Use runtime credentials with SELECT access to the required global/realm tables,
separate from the administrative setup account. Startup checks the required
projections and dependencies before opening listeners. `/healthz` and `/readyz`
return 200 when dependencies are available and 503 when unavailable; readiness
is refreshed every two seconds. SIGINT/SIGTERM drain pending commands, release
session leases and close pools. Logs omit account/device IDs, secrets and raw
query/driver errors.

## Compatibility and persistence boundaries

- Login requires existing `userprofile` and matching global `account_new` rows,
  device binding, supported mobile channel, valid signature and no active ban.
  Legacy `cmdBaseTime` is signed literally; the web timestamp window is not
  applied to this mobile path. Firebase auth/account provisioning remain future work.
- PostgreSQL data is read through `@opencok/drizzle` using typed table modules.
  Global accounts use their own physical database connection; game reads use the
  selected realm. City/map snapshots use read-only repeatable-read transactions
  and UTC. PostgreSQL bigint values remain exact until SFS serialization.
- Redis sessions and ZooKeeper registrations are scoped to the realm.
  ZooKeeper prevents simultaneous registration at `/opencok-experiment/COK<id>`;
  this is a read-only migration slice. Epoch fencing is still required before
  enabling authoritative mutations, as defined in the architecture.
- Map reads use PostgreSQL, avoiding the proof of concept's unscoped `world1`
  cache. Only base-world terrain, unallied cities and resources have migrated
  DTOs. Realms with active marches, specialized points or unsupported queue
  types fail explicitly rather than advertising incomplete simulation state.
- No schema or migration is added here. Existing PostgreSQL migrations remain
  unchanged. MySQL/MariaDB records are **not transferred** by this change;
  preparing existing accounts/cities requires a separate reviewed data migration.
  Empty databases do not automatically create or reset player state.
- Optional features and commerce remain closed. Other client versions, APK
  rendering and real-client discovery against this PostgreSQL server remain
  unvalidated. The source proof of concept's successful APK connection does not
  establish that validation for this port.

## Gameplay migration: topics 1–8

The [migration inventory](https://github.com/ReeseArch64/opencok/discussions/27#discussioncomment-19156446)
defines the full requested scope. Implementation and verification remain incremental;
the table records gaps rather than treating package scaffolding as completed behavior.
The current work is restricted to server implementation and unit tests. Do not run
ADB, native-client validation, integration or end-to-end tests for this phase.

Unit fixtures are synthetic and do not load ignored Java inputs or player databases.
The availability and settings tests cover protocol types, correlation, catalog
absence, grouped records, numeric versions, realm ranges, inclusive deadlines,
invalid calendar values and time-dependent building previews. The full wave is not
complete until all eight server-side behaviors have corresponding unit coverage.

## Verification

```sh
bun run --cwd apps/server check-types
bun run --cwd apps/server test
bun run --cwd packages/env test
bun run --cwd apps/server test:mutations
bun run --cwd apps/server test:integration
```

The integration suite owns disposable Docker instances of PostgreSQL
`17.11-bookworm`, Redis `6.2.24-bookworm` and ZooKeeper `3.4.14` (the source
experiment's Redis/ZooKeeper versions). It applies the real Drizzle migrations,
creates only synthetic XML/accounts and tests TCP login, rejection paths,
city/army/inventory/map reads, realm isolation, exact bigint transport,
unsupported mutations, process restart and Redis failure/recovery. Docker must
be running; missing dependencies fail the suite. It does not accept deployment
URLs or use private resources. A synthetic SFS client verifies wire responses;
APK/device validation and production dependency versions are separate gates.

A focused mutation check runs the login tests against seven disabled auth guards in
a temporary test bundle: signature, device binding, account activation, realm,
account device and both ban checks. Every mutant must fail its tests. This is a
bounded auth check, not the architecture's future repository-wide Stryker suite.
