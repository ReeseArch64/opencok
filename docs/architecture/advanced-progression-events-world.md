# Advanced progression, local events and dynamic world migration

[Issue 385](https://github.com/ReeseArch64/opencok/issues/385) tracks topics 25, 26 and 27 as separate migration areas. This document tracks implemented
slices and remaining acceptance; a command registration is not completion evidence.
The compatibility target is the 12.06.0 server contract. Native APK execution and
other client tracks remain unverified. Private reference inputs are read-only and
are not runtime dependencies.

## Civilization science

`civilization.science.data.init`, `race.science.research`, `race.science.directly`
and `race.science.upgrade` use the existing city mutation boundary and queue type 19. Research resolves contiguous catalog levels, validates building, civilization
science, prestige and VIP prerequisites, and charges the authoritative inventory
ledger. The next level is pinned in the activity; a retry cannot charge or complete
the same operation twice. Resource cancellation refunds half the recorded paid
amounts; consumed items are not refunded. Imported queues retain their deadlines
and do not replay start costs.

Effects remain sourced from `user_civilization_science`. Updates settle production
under the old effects before applying the level, then rebuild the future schedule.
The protocol preserves float effect fields, string catalog fields and long
milliseconds. The native completion command checks queue type, target and deadline.
Generic queue acceleration and cancellation use the shared lifecycle.

The implementation adds no schema or dependency. Existing type-19 queues are used;
this slice does not grant missing queues, prestige or currency. Operators should
back up realm state before rollout. Rollback must retain research rows, activity
identities, receipts and production checkpoints. A binary without this domain must
leave its pending queues blocked rather than clear or complete them.

Synthetic tests exercise prerequisites, costs, wire types, four concurrent retries,
wrong-target completion, duplicate completion and cancellation against a disposable
PostgreSQL instance. No test uses the operator's running realm or player data.

## Remaining topic boundaries

| Topic | Modules still requiring implementation and acceptance                                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 25    | Dragon lifecycle, travel, feeding, skills and dedicated resources; civilization castle; totems; native-client progression acceptance |
| 26    | Local schedules, enrollment, score producers, lotteries, anniversary, expedition and arena; durable reward and period acceptance     |
| 27    | Troop reservations, march creation/movement/gathering/return, acceleration, teleport and world interest publication                  |

Existing read projections, catalogs, rankings and schema definitions are reused,
but do not establish that these mutations are implemented. Combat-dependent modes
must use their corresponding validated engine before being enabled. No generic
victory or empty success response substitutes for combat acceptance.
